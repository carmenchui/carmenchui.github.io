* Knowledge representation & modelling
* Automated reasoning of first-order ontologies
* Applications of ontologies to data and knowledge integration
* Engineering education


My disseration research aims at developing modular ontologies for manufacturing and medicinal chemistry.  Please click the following link to learn more: [A Molecular Structure Ontology for Medicinal Chemistry](/most/).
