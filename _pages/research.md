My research interests fall in the following areas:
* Ontology design, mapping, and integration
* Knowledge representation & modelling
* Automated reasoning of first-order ontologies
* Applications of ontologies to data and knowledge integration
* Engineering education


My disseration research aims at developing modular ontologies for manufacturing and medicinal chemistry. Feel free to take a look at my [publications](publications/) to know more about my research.

### Research Statement

My research focuses on the formal logical representations of semantic descriptions of information, **ontologies**, and their applications.  In particular, my work revolves around how information can be efficiently obtained and represented in logical form; a key focus of my work is to determine how to manage and break down large ontologies to ensure they capture the correct semantics, are intrinsically and logically correct, and can be combined with different (smaller) ontologies.  My work contributes to the advancement of knowledge representation, artificial intelligence and logic, with applications in engineering, chemistry, and geometry.  

Currently, I am developing an ontology for molecular structure to aid medicinal chemists with drug discovery and drug synthesis.  The field of medicinal chemistry involves the design, synthesis, and development of new drugs that can be further enhanced with the application of ontologies.
A molecular structure ontology can serve as an ontology of 'building blocks' -- users can build up big molecules by picking and choosing components of the ontology to combine.  

Since the process of synthesizing new molecules is tedious and meticulous, the development of this ontology can allow chemists to combine functional groups and atoms together in an ontological fashion to determine the types of reactions, structural properties, or molecular compounds that will result from the combinations.  Current work done in the chemistry community indicates that there is an interest in the automatic synthesis of molecular building blocks of simple drugs -- 
With an ontology, it would be possible to develop software systems to provide decision support for drug discovery.
