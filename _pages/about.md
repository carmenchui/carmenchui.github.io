Hi there!  

I am Carmen, an Industrial Engineering Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering](http://www.mie.utoronto.ca/){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/){:target="_blank"}.

# Research Interests
My research interests fall in the following areas:
* Ontology design, mapping, and integration
* Knowledge representation & modelling
* Automated reasoning of first-order ontologies
* Applications of ontologies to data and knowledge integration
* Engineering education


My disseration research aims at developing modular ontologies for manufacturing and medicinal chemistry. Take a look at my [publications](publications/) to know more about my research.

My advisor is Dr. [Michael Gruninger](http://stl.mie.utoronto.ca/gruninger.html){:target="_blank"}, and I am member of the [STL](https://stl.mie.utoronto.ca/){:target="_blank"} (Semantic Technologies Lab) Group, and am part of the [IAOA](http://www.iaoa.org/){:target="_blank"}, [IISE](http://www.iise.org/Home/){:target="_blank"}, [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/index.html){:target="_blank"}, and [OSPE](https://www.ospe.on.ca/){:target="_blank"} associations.
