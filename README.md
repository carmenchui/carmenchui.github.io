Welcome to the repo for my personal website! I created this website following [Alison Hill's tutorial](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/) and the [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) she co-authored with Yihui Xie and Amber Thomas. If you are interested in making your own  blogdown website with a similar layout, I would highly encourage you to check out these resources.
