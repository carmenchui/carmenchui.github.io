## Research Theses

My Ph.D. research involved the development of a molecular structure ontology for medicinal chemistry, with a basis in graph theory, as well as new techniques for (first-order) model construction.

My M.A.Sc. research involved the analysis of the [Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE)](http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/dolce/overview.html) and its relationships to ontologies found in the [COmmon Logic Ontology Repository (COLORE)](http://colore.oor.net/).

My B.A.Sc. research examined the Frame Problem and how the Process Specification Language (PSL) ontology can be used to prove the Inertia Principle.  This undergraduate thesis project was completed for the MIE498 course at the University of Toronto.
