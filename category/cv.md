## mentoring

As part of the APS 1203/1204 course offered with the Prospective Professors in Training (PPIT) program, I was a **mentor** for a group of six first-year undergraduate students taking their Engineering Strategies & Practice II (APS 112) course in the Winter 2017 semester. The group's project is to redesign mathematics in the classroom to make the subject more engaging and interesting for high-school students. We have been featured in the UofT Engineering News in the following article:
