My research interests fall in the following areas:
* Ontology design, mapping, and integration
* Knowledge representation & modelling
* Automated reasoning of first-order ontologies
* Applications of ontologies to data and knowledge integration
* Engineering education


My Ph.D. research involved the development of a molecular structure ontology for medicinal chemistry, with a basis in graph theory, as well as new techniques for (first-order) model construction.
