My research interests fall in the following areas:
* Ontology design, mapping, and integration
* Knowledge representation & modelling
* Automated reasoning of first-order ontologies
* Applications of ontologies to data and knowledge integration
* Engineering education


## Research Theses

My Ph.D. research involved the development of a molecular structure ontology for medicinal chemistry, with a basis in graph theory, as well as new techniques for (first-order) model construction.

My M.A.Sc. research involved the analysis of the [Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE)](http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/dolce/overview.html) and its relationships to ontologies found in the [COmmon Logic Ontology Repository (COLORE)](http://colore.oor.net/).
