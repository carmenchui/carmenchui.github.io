# welcome

Hi there!  

I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Toronto working with the Data & Analytics team at Royal Bank Canada (RBC).

My research involves the analysis of ontologies in financial technology and e-science.  I have worked on projects to develop and analyze ontologies in science (manufacturing, geometry, chemistry).

My postdoctoral advisor is Dr. [Michael Gruninger](http://stl.mie.utoronto.ca/gruninger.html){:target="_blank"}, who is the director of the [Semantic Technologies Lab (STL)](http://stl.mie.utoronto.ca/){:target="_blank"}. I am also part of the [EDM Council](https://edmcouncil.org/){:target="_blank"}, [IAOA](http://www.iaoa.org/){:target="_blank"}, [IISE](http://www.iise.org/Home/){:target="_blank"}, [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/index.html){:target="_blank"}, and [OSPE](https://www.ospe.on.ca/){:target="_blank"} associations.

I'm Carmen, an Industrial Engineering Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering](http://www.mie.utoronto.ca/){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/){:target="_blank"}.

My current research involves the design of a molecular structure ontology for medicinal chemistry and drug discovery.

I hope to acquire research, teaching, and working experience in an environment where my skills and educational foundation can be further developed.
