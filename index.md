## About
Hi, my name is Carmen (my pronouns are she/her).

I hold a doctorate in Industrial Engineering from the University of Toronto and trained under [Prof. Michael Gruninger](http://stl.mie.utoronto.ca/gruninger.html) in the Semantic Technologies Lab.

I specialize in the design and analysis of ontologies in first-order logic, particularly automated reasoning and verification, in addition to knowledge representation and modelling in multidisciplinary areas.

Currently, I am a Senior Business Data Architect in the Data Architecture & Analysis team at [The Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank)](http://www.scotiabank.com), working on the Scotiabank Business Information Model (SBIM).

My research interests include:
- Ontology design, mapping, and integration
- Knowledge representation and modelling
- Automated reasoning of first-order ontologies
- Applications of ontologies to data and knowledge integration
- Engineering education
